After completing a task, ensure the following:
1.  **Build**: The project builds successfully using `dotnet build`.
2.  **Functionality**: The application runs and the changes work as expected by running `dotnet run`.
    *   Verify BGM playback starts/pauses/stops correctly with the timer.
    *   Verify custom time-up sound plays when the timer finishes.
3.  **Code Style**: Adherence to the established code style and conventions (e.g., 4-space indentation, XML documentation comments).
4.  **Testing**: If new features are added or bugs are fixed, consider adding or updating unit tests (run with `dotnet test`).
5.  **No Linting/Formatting tools identified**: Currently, no specific linting or formatting tools have been identified. Follow the existing code style manually.
